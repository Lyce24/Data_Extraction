# Data_Extraction
consists from 2 parts: stats.py and chats.py

#stats.py
#This program processes a series of lines of text, looking for contiguous runs of alphabetic characters treating them each as a word. For each such word, it keeps a count of the number of its occurrences in the text.

#chats.py
#Process a text and distill statistics about the bi-gram and tri-gram word occurrences in the entered text. It does this by using a dictionary of words and bi-grams. Each dictionary entry gives the list of words in the text that follow that word/bi-gram (and possibly a count of the number of times each follower does so). The code then generates random text based on these statistics.
